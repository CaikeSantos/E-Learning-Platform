<h1>E-Learning Platform</h1>
<p>The E-Learning Platform is a project of the subject "Database Management Systems".

The objective of the project developed in this discipline is to provide students with practical experience in implementing and deploying real database systems. By applying the theoretical concepts covered in the classroom, students will be challenged to physically build databases using SQL programming environments and resources available in database management software.

The project aims to equip students to work with a variety of programming methods, both internal and external to database management systems, enabling them to efficiently integrate the developed database with other software systems. At the end of the project, it is expected that students will have acquired practical skills and substantial knowledge that will prepare them to face challenges in the development and management of database systems in a professional environment.</p>

<h3>Context:</h3>
<p>An E-learning platform (online courses) allows students to register and subscribe to courses taught by a teacher. A student, if they wish, can subscribe to one or more courses available on the platform, and similarly, a course, if it has any registered students, can have multiple subscribers. A student is identified by their CPF (Brazilian Individual Taxpayer Registry), and each student has a name, age (>= 16 years), a gender (male, female, other), and a unique email address.

Courses available on the platform are identified by a unique code, and they have a title, total duration (in hours), category (Technology, Administration, Culinary, Nursing, Nutrition, Arts, Music, Engineering, other), course rating (rated from 0 to 5), and the responsible teacher who teaches the course. Each course is taught by only one teacher. A teacher may not have any registered courses (for new teachers, for example), or they may have one or more courses. The teacher is identified by their CPF, and they have a name, age (>= 20 years), gender (male, female, other), email, registration date on the platform, and a unique email address.

When subscribing to a course, the system records the subscription date. Additionally, the system allows checking if the student has a certificate for a course they subscribed to (which proves the completion of the course), the date of the student's last access to the course, the total number of accesses, and a comment from the student about the course.</p>
